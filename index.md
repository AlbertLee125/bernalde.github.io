I am an associate scientist in <b>quantum computing</b> at the NASA Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) Research Institute of Advanced Computer Science. I will be joining the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2023. I like working on optimization problems with applications in science and engineering and have experience in the study, design, and implementation of such algorithms using hybrid and novel hardware technologies, including quantum computing, graphical processing units, and classical computing. I focus on applications related to challenging problems in chemical, process, and energy systems engineering. Discrete nonlinear optimization problems, known in the literature as mixed-integer nonlinear programs, are my favorites!
