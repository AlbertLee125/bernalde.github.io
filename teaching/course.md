# Chemical Process Modeling (CBE 255)
 At UW-Madison I co-instruct this course focusing on the computer programming course material. The course provides an integrative overview of the entire chemical engineering curriculum. By the end of this course, the students had a set of tools that have been selected by the faculty in the latter courses as most useful to them as instructors.

 # Computer Programming and Decision-making Tools Short Course
 I developed this course in the Julia language which I taught at UW-Madison, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and at an international workshop in South Korea. I am currently organizing plans to offer these courses in Spanish and English as part of an initiative to establish new connections with underrepresented regions of Latin America (e.g., Peru).
