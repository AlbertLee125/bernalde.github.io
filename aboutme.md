			<h2>Joshua Pulsipher</h2>
		</header> -->
		<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/profile.png %}" alt="" /></span>I am post-doctoral researcher in chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University specializing in data-science and decision-making under uncertainty to tackle high-impact engineering challenges in effort to do my small part in making the world a better place to live. I have conducted academic research and teaching over the past 10 years across a variety of instituions. I currently work with Professors <a href="http://allthingsoptimal.com/">Carl Laird</a> and <a href="http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/">Ignacio Grossmann</a> in developing methods in process systems engineering to tackle applications in energy systems, rare-earth element recovery, and more. To date, my accomplishments include 13 completed scholarly publications, 1 pending patent, 5 software products, contributing to proposals totaling \$698K in funding, 33+ presentations/seminars, teaching 6 courses, and my network of 27+ collaborators in academia, national laboratories, and industry.</p>
